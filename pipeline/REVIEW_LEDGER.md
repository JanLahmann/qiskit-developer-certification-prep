# Review Ledger — verified facts, hazards, and recipes

Carry-forward knowledge for generation and review agents. **Read this before
touching the question bank; append (never delete) when you verify something
new.** Every entry here was empirically verified or observed during a review
wave — do not contradict an entry without re-verifying and updating it.

Format: keep entries terse, dated, and falsifiable. This file exists because
review knowledge previously lived only in the orchestrator's session context
and died with it.

## Verified library facts (pinned stack: qiskit 2.5.0 / runtime 0.48.0 / aer 0.17.2)

- **SamplerV2 has NO `resilience_level`** (pydantic ValidationError on assignment);
  EstimatorV2 has it (0/1/2, default 1). SamplerV2 noise management = dynamical
  decoupling + Pauli twirling only. The official objective wording "set sampler
  primitive options such as resilience levels" contradicts the library — questions
  state library reality and reconcile in the explanation. (2026-07-25, s5 wave)
- **Fake-backend shots trap:** Runtime primitives on fake backends silently use
  `qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2` defaults (`default_shots=1024`); the real
  Runtime service default is **4096** (twirling auto = 32×128; fallback chain in
  guides/sampler-options). Any answer depending on an unspecified shot count is
  provably-wrong-but-passing. Killed s5-q012 over this. (2026-07-25)
- **`RuntimeJobV2.done()/.errored()/.running()/.in_final_state()/.wait_for_final_state()/.metrics()/.usage()` all EXIST** in runtime 0.48. `.metrics()`/`.usage()` are not observable on local primitives — proofs must not assert them locally. (2026-07-25, s7)
- **`RuntimeJobV2.status()` returns a plain string** (`"DONE"` etc.), not a
  `JobStatus` enum; the enum is still importable and compares False vs strings —
  a good distractor, a wrong claim if keyed. (2026-07-25, s7)
- **`DataBin` supports attribute AND item access** (`db["meas"]` works); has
  `keys/values/items/shape/ndim/size`; has NO `get_counts()` and NO `registers`.
  Never use `db["name"]` as a wrong option. (2026-07-25, s7)
- **`StatevectorEstimator` rejects measured circuits** (QiskitError) but Runtime
  `EstimatorV2` on a fake backend ACCEPTS them — implementation-fragile territory;
  version-scope or avoid. `StatevectorEstimator` also reports `stds=0.0` even with
  `default_precision` set; only Runtime EstimatorV2 (fake backend suffices) yields
  a real standard error. (2026-07-25, s6/s7)
- **`QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str/from_qasm_file` still exist in Qiskit 2.5** and
  work — never key "removed in 2.x", never offer as distractor where it would be
  a second correct answer. `c_if` IS removed in 2.x; `qiskit.tools` is gone
  (ModuleNotFoundError). (2026-07-25, s8/s2)
- **qasm3 asymmetry:** `qiskit.qasm3.dumps/dump` are native; `loads/load` require
  the `qiskit-qasm3-import` package (MissingOptionalLibraryError without it — and
  that package is NOT in our .venv; proofs must block/handle it). `qiskit.qasm2`
  does both natively. (2026-07-25, s8)
- **`Operator.compose` applies self FIRST (B·A); `.dot` is A·B.** (2026-07-25, s1)
- **`json.dump(x, cls=RuntimeDecoder)`** fails with TypeError (Decoder passed
  where Encoder belongs) — verified distractor. (2026-07-25, s7)
- **`session.details()` returns None in local testing mode** (guard at
  session.py:296); live keys incl. state/accepting_jobs/max_time/last_job_completed.
  `backend=`/`session=` kwargs removed in favor of `mode=`. (2026-07-20/25)

## Documentation link facts

- **404 (dead):** `guides/get-started-with-primitives` (→ use get-started-with-sampler /
  get-started-with-estimator), `guides/specify-runtime-options` (→ sampler-options /
  estimator-options).
- **Content-free redirects (treat as dead; check_links now fails on slug mismatch):**
  `guides/primitives-rest-api` → guides/primitives (no REST content; → use
  sampler-rest-api / estimator-rest-api / cloud-setup-rest-api),
  `guides/map-problem-to-circuits` → intro-to-patterns.
- **301 (normalize):** `guides/configure-error-suppression` →
  `guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques`.
- Locale redirect `/docs/X` → `/docs/en/X` is normal, not drift.
- Good primitive-specific pages: sampler-input-output, sampler-noise-management,
  sampler-options, estimator-options, estimator-noise-management,
  get-started-with-sampler, get-started-with-estimator. (2026-07-25)

## Meta-pattern calibration recipes (audit: pipeline/audit_meta_patterns.py)

- **Target CHANCE (25%), never zero.** Every naive fix inverts the tell; the audit
  measures both directions (longest/avoid_longest, most_hedged/avoid_hedged,
  least_absolute/most_absolute). Instrument the inverse BEFORE fixing the forward tell.
- **Length recipe:** ~N/4 questions correct-strictly-longest (ratio ≤1.3), every
  other question exactly ONE distractor strictly longest. Ties are the trap
  (2-way tie with correct: 0.5 to longest, 0 to avoid_longest — strictly worse
  than correct-longest). All-four-equal questions are free ballast (avoid_longest
  abstains). Correct-is-shortest should also happen ~N/4 (s3 hit 6% and taught
  "avoid the shortest").
- **Absolutes 3:1 recipe:** per ~4 affected questions, 3× "one distractor carries
  the absolute + another distractor hedges", 1× factually-true absolute in the
  correct option.
- **Hedges:** let 1–2 correct options truthfully carry "typically"/"by default";
  ≥3 hedged distractors in one question drives avoid_hedged to 1.0 for it.
- **Tokenizer quirks:** `word_set` splits on non-alpha → `measure_all()` counts as
  absolute "all", `default_shots` as hedge "default", `most_available` as hedge
  "most". `tokens()` keeps underscores → `num_qubits` is one stem-echo token.
  Never remove real API idioms to silence a flag; compensate elsewhere.
- **Fix length + absolutes TOGETHER:** trimming a correct option can create an
  absolute tell that wasn't there (s4).
- **Known accepted residuals (2026-07-25 bank-wide):** shortest_option 16.7%,
  odd_one_out 13.4% (below chance; weak inverse exploits ~27%), similar_twin_member
  27.8%, 48 deliberate low length flags, 2 benign cross-question duplicate option
  texts in s6 (same real API path, different stems, no contradiction).

## Proof-quality hazards

- **Circular proofs:** a proof that recomputes the question's own formula proves
  nothing (s6-q017). Proofs must OBSERVE independently (measure spread, catch the
  exception, diff the output).
- **Proof/option drift:** verify_bank checks the verdict, not whether evidence
  strings still describe current option texts (s4-q023 said shots=256 while the
  stem said 1024; s4-q038 proof exercised a different call than the option showed).
  `pipeline/lint_proof_drift.py` now flags kwarg-like tokens and ≥3-digit numbers
  in evidence that appear nowhere in the question — run it after rewriting options.
- Evidence must reference option KEYS, and per-option evidence must cover every key.
- Never reference display letters in explanations/evidence ("option A") — the site
  shuffles positions at render time (2026-07-25); stored keys ≠ shown letters.

## Community-bank intelligence (validation passes 1–2, 14/23 exams)

- Highest-yield distractor classes observed in real banks: PUB bracketing
  (`[o1,o2]` shape (2,) vs `[[o1],[o2]]` shape (2,1)); near-miss kwargs
  (`order=`→none, `group_wise=`→`qubit_wise=`, `dumps`→`dump`,
  `bind_parameters`→`assign_parameters`); V1 signatures (`run(circuits=,
  observables=)`).
- Similarity kills so far: s1-q011, s1-q046, s6-q020 (vantnprof), s7-q010/q013/q028
  reworked (vantnprof/marcobarroca/adrian). Always check data/community/parsed/*.json.
- Provenance flags (neutral, unadjudicated): Luke-J-Miller repo redistributes
  official IBM sample-test/study-guide PDFs; quantum-tokyo reproduces the official
  sample test with attribution. Luke's parsed bank is stored as fingerprints only
  (unlicensed, 1035 Qs); raw pickle gitignored.

## Distractor pools (2026-07-25)

- Schema: optional `display_count` (4–5); must be < len(options) and leave >= 2
  displayed distractors. Runtime: `shuffledOptions()` seededly samples distractors
  (correct always shown), then position-shuffles; same seed = same subset+layout.
- Pool distractors need: named misconception + explanation entry + proof
  attempt/refutation with evidence (executed questions). Keys append alphabetically
  (E, F). Anki decks show the full pool (stored order).
- The audit enumerates displayed variants: a tell in ANY variant flags the question;
  aggregate heuristics weight variants uniformly. Gold pilots: s5-q019 (executed,
  enabled-vs-enable near-miss E), s4-q001 (conceptual, session-max_time misuse E).
- Multis with 4+ correct answers cannot pool (display_count constraint) — skip them.
- Highest-yield pool distractor classes: near-miss attribute/kwarg names
  (enable/enabled, dump/dumps, qubit_wise/group_wise), PUB bracketing, V1
  signatures, wrong-options-group paths (resilience on Sampler, twirling fields
  on dynamical_decoupling).
- **Options cap is 6** (schema `maxItems`): a 5-option question can take exactly
  ONE pool distractor, a 4-option question two. 3-correct multis need
  `display_count: 5`. (2026-07-25, s1 pool wave)
- **Pool length rules (derived on the s1 wave — a variant can create a tell the
  base question does not have):** (a) if the correct option is currently strictly
  longest, keep new distractors ≤ correct AND ≥ the longest existing distractor —
  the variant that drops that distractor otherwise raises the ratio (s1-q040 would
  have gone 1.21 → 1.52 = HIGH); (b) if the correct option is NOT longest, new
  distractors must be ≥ len(correct), because one variant always drops the current
  longest distractor.
- **Pool hedge/absolute rule:** the absolute/hedge balance is re-evaluated per
  variant. If a question's only hedged distractor can be dropped while an
  absolute-carrying distractor survives, the new pool distractor MUST carry the
  hedge, or `absolute_distractor_tell` (medium) fires (hit s1-q015/018/041/042/047
  in design; all pre-empted).
- **Pool stem-echo rule:** dropping the high-overlap distractor can expose a
  `stem_echo_tell` (medium). Caught live on s1-q037 (correct overlap 4 vs 2 after
  the twin distractor was dropped); fixed by giving the pool distractor ≥3
  stem-vocabulary tokens (`qubit`, `operator`, `tensor`).
- Do NOT offer `Pauli(...).reverse_qargs()` as a distractor on label-order
  questions — it genuinely reverses qubit order and would be a second correct
  answer. `.adjoint()` is the safe near-miss (Hermitian labels return unchanged).
- Predict-output pools: a wrong-VALUE option must not duplicate another option's
  value (two options claiming the same output is itself a tell). For 2-qubit index
  questions the value space (0–3) is exhausted after 4 options — use a type/shape
  error ("raises", "length-2 vector", "dict keys") instead.

## Verified library facts (s1 pool wave, 2026-07-25, qiskit 2.5.0)

- `Statevector.from_int(2, dims=4)` **accepts an int `dims`** (total dimension) and
  returns dims `(2, 2)` — "dims must be a tuple" is a safe, refuted distractor.
- `Statevector.probabilities_dict()` keys are **`np.str_` bitstrings** (str
  subclass), never ints; `probabilities([q])` returns an **ndarray**, not a dict.
- `Statevector(qc)` (constructor) raises the **same** QiskitError as
  `from_instruction` on a measured circuit (`Cannot apply instruction with
  classical bits: measure`) — there is no constructor bypass.
- `Statevector.evolve` is functional: returns a NEW Statevector, source unchanged
  (never in-place / never None).
- `Statevector.from_label` accepts **multi-character** labels and '+','-','r','l'.
- `Pauli` labels accept a **phase prefix** (`Pauli('-iXZ').phase == 1`); a plain
  multi-letter label has phase 0, so `Pauli('XZ').to_matrix()` is exactly X⊗Z.
- `Pauli('ZI').adjoint()` returns `'ZI'` (Hermitian) — adjoint never reverses
  qubit order.
- `SparsePauliOp.simplify()` **sums** duplicate terms (1+2 → 3), never averages,
  and only drops coefficients that are zero within `atol` (a coeff-1 term survives).
- Pauli products: X·Y = iZ, Y·Z = iX, Z·X = iY; reversing the operands conjugates
  the phase (Z·Y = −iX). `Pauli('ZI').commutes(Pauli('XX'))` is False — an identity
  factor does not buy commutation.
- `Operator.equiv` (up to global phase): T ≢ RZ(π/2) (that is S), H ≢ RY(π/2)
  (determinants differ in sign); H = RY(π/2)·Z.

## Process rules

- Reviewers/generators run BOTH gates per batch: `verify_bank.py --section sX`
  AND `audit_meta_patterns.py --section sX` (0 blockers/warnings, no high/medium
  flags). The audit artifact data/audits/meta_pattern_audit.* is section-scoped
  to the last run — always re-run bank-wide (`--gate`) before assembly.
- The orchestrator independently re-runs both gates after every agent — and after
  its own edits (an orchestrator touch-up once created a new medium flag).
- Reality wins: fix the question, never the proof.
- Append what you verify to this ledger.
